Sysl (the System Specification Language) is a language to describe data models, systems and 
interactions between systems in a text-based, version-controlled single source of truth. It is also 
a tool to interpret those specifications and automatically generate design, build and test 
artefacts, such as UML diagrams, Excel spreadsheets and code.

Sysl is [open source on GitHub][github].
