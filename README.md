## Sysl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anz-bank/sysl-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anz-bank/sysl-website)

Sysl (pronounced "sizzle") is a system specification language. Using Sysl, you can specify systems, endpoints, endpoint behaviour, data models and data transformations. The Sysl compiler automatically generates sequence diagrams, integrations, and other views and also offers a range of code generation options, all from a common Sysl spec. The set of outputs is open-ended and will grow to support other representations in future.
